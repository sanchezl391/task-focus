## About TASK-FOCUS
Task Focus is a pomodoro web application that allows a user to work for a set period of time and take a break. The idea is that the user focuses for the set period of time and then takes a break. The break allows the user to relax and avoid fatigue and stress. A message can be set for push notifications to remind the user to perform another task, such as do laundry, plan out day, exercise, etc.
